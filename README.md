# Sentiment Analysis on Emotional States

This project analyzes text to predict emotional states using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a model that can predict emotional states such as anxiety, depression, stress, and others based on text input. We used Logistic Regression, along with TF-IDF for text vectorization, and evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Dataset

The dataset contains thousands of statements labeled with different emotional states. The data was cleaned and preprocessed to ensure optimal performance.
